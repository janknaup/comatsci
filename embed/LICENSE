  Terms and conditions to obtain a copy of comatsci-embed

  Preamble

In the following the term "author" refers to Jan M. Knaup. The 
term "program" shall mean the copyrighted comatsci-qmmm package 
(in source, object and executable form). 

This licence covers the use of comatsci-qmmm for non-commercial 
purposes as ene extension to the comatsci package, other uses may 
be arranged individually by discussion with the author.

  Mandatory terms and conditions

I request a copy of the comatsci-qmmm package and therefore agree 
to the following terms and conditions to use the program and to 
have access to the source code: 

1. All title, ownership and rights to the program or to any 
  copies of it remain with the author, regardless of the 
  ownership of the media on which the program is used or 
  installed.

2. I will not provide a copy of the program in any way to anyone 
  for any reason whatsoever. I may make copies of the code but 
  only for backup purposes, or to use it on any of my group's 
  computer resources. I will refer any request for copies of the 
  program to the author. Anyone directly associated with my 
  research group is covered by the licence and may share my copy 
  of the program on all of my group's computer resources as long 
  as they agree to the mandatory terms and conditions.

3. I will not redistribute any part of the program as part of 
  another software without written permission of the author.

4. The program and any documentation is supplied on an as is 
  basis without any warranty, and thus with no additional 
  responsibility or liability. I understand that support for 
  running the program can not be provided in general, except on 
  the basis of a joint project between the code author and the 
  research partner.

5. It is obvious that modifications of the program can lead to 
  problems where the author may not be able to help. It is 
  encouraged that I report any difficulties encountered in the 
  use of standard versions of the program, which I have not 
  modified, to the author.

6. Users are encouraged to report useful modifications to 
  programs to the author. I agree that any reported modifications 
  could be incorporated into the program, potentially with 
  further modifications. I certify that I am entitled to, and 
  bear responsibility for contributing these modifications to the 
  program and that they will be covered by this licence once 
  incorporated. The contributed modifications are non-exclusively 
  for use in the program, so that my rights to use the original 
  modifications I have contributed for other purposes are not 
  affected.

7. In any publication derived from use of the program, I will 
  make references to relevant papers about the program 
  (comatsci-qmmm), the QM/MM coupling method method and any 
  appropriate extensions used. The manual of the program contains 
  the list of the papers to consider for citation.

8. One copy of each and every publication resulting from use of 
  the program will be sent to the contact address of the author 
  for their attention.

9. comatsci-qmmm may rely on external libraries for operation. If 
  any of these libraries are included in the comatsci-qmmm 
  distribution, the repsective terms and conditions for their 
  redistribution libraries are given in the appropriate source 
  directories.
